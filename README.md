# üöÄ FocusChain

**FocusChain** is a real-time, blockchain-based attendance and focus tracking system designed to promote transparency, productivity, and accountability. It combines smart contract technology with real-time focus tracking (inspired by Yeolpumta) to deliver a modern attendance system.
